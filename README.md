# DDR3-Vs-DDR4
DDR (Double Data Rate 3rd and 4th Generation) Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory – RAM
The Development
Atari came with 1 KB of Memory and after that Apple Computer came with the first 128 KB of memory in Macintosh.
Samsung came up with SDRAM in the year 1993 which became a standard for Computing.
The first DDR SDRAM began to be sold in 1996 (DDR RAM is known as Double Data Rate Synchronous – Dynamic Random Access Memory).
In the year 2003 DDR2 SDRAM begin being sold commercial. It was Reliable, Economical and is compatible with most of the Computers that were introduced with Intel’s Dual Core, Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5 & Core i7 generation of Processors. It was highly recommended for PC, running Applications which required more Resources but lesser Energy.
 Post June 2008 the sale for DDR3 SDRAM became mainstream in the Industry. DDR 3 came into the market when the 2nd Generation of Core i3, Core i5 & Core i7 was widely available but the market was drifting towards the 3rd Generation of Intel CPU. The reason why DDR3 became Mainstream was because of its ability to Process quickly, offered more Bandwidth while consuming less Energy compared to DDR2.
